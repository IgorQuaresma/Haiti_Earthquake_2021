Step 1
Tool - Segmentation (otb)
input: original image   
params: meanshift  +  8 neighborhood
output: segmentation_results

Step 2
Tool - Zonal Statistics (otb)
input: input image original image / input vector segmentation results
params: standard
output: segmentation_statistics

Step 3
Tool - join attributes by location (vector general)
input: base layer segmentation statistics / join layer sample / join type take attributes of the first matching feature only (one to one) / check-> discard records which could not be joined 
params: 
output: joined layer


Step 4
Tool - TrainVectorClassifier (otb)
input: input vector data -> joined layer / field names for training features -> mean_0 stdev0, mean_1 stdev 1, mean_2 stdev 2 / field cotaining the class integer labels for supervision -> class_id (samples)
params: classifier to use for the training libsvm
output: obia_model.model


Step 5
Tool - VectorClassifier (otb)
input: segmentation_statistics
params: model file -> obia_model
output: classified_output


Step 6
change simbology classified_output to categorized 
value -> predicted
change the legend according to the notes used when sampling 


Step 7
Tool - dissolve (normal)
input: classified_output
params: dissolve field -> predicted
output: dissolved_layer
